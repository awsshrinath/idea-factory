# Authentication Feature: Final Status

**Overall Status: Completed**

A comprehensive, production-grade authentication system was implemented, integrating the Next.js frontend with the Express backend using Supabase. All 22 planned tasks were completed successfully.

### Completed Task Summary:

*   **Task 1: Setup Project Repository (Done)**: Project structure was already in place.
*   **Task 2: Configure Supabase Client (Done)**: Verified backend client and configured the frontend client with a `SessionContextProvider`.
*   **Task 3: Implement JWT Token Validation Middleware (Done)**: Created and applied middleware on the Express backend to validate Supabase JWTs on protected routes.
*   **Task 4: Develop Protected Route Decorator (Done)**: Achieved by applying the auth middleware directly to Express route groups.
*   **Task 5: Create Token Refresh Endpoint (Done)**: Made obsolete and handled by the Supabase client-side library. No backend endpoint was needed.
*   **Task 6: Sync User Profile with Supabase (Done)**: Implemented a database trigger to automatically create a `profiles` entry for new users.
*   **Task 7: Setup Supabase Auth Provider in Next.js (Done)**: Completed by adding the `SessionContextProvider` to the main `App.tsx` file.
*   **Task 8: Implement Automatic Token Attachment (Done)**: Refactored the `ApiClient` to get the latest token from the Supabase session for every request.
*   **Task 9: Manage Auth State Across App (Done)**: Created a custom `useAuth` hook to provide a clean, centralized interface for auth state and actions.
*   **Task 10: Create Protected Route Components (Done)**: Implemented a `<ProtectedRoute>` component to guard frontend routes.
*   **Task 11: Integrate Login/Logout Flow (Done)**: Implemented a login page using the Supabase UI component and added a sign-out button to the sidebar.
*   **Task 12: Implement Automatic Token Refresh (Done)**: Handled automatically by the Supabase `SessionContextProvider`.
*   **Task 13: Secure Token Storage (Done)**: Handled by the Supabase client library, which uses `localStorage` for SPAs, following best practices.
*   **Task 14: Validate Tokens on Both Sides (Done)**: Handled by the backend middleware and the frontend Supabase library.
*   **Task 15: Implement Logout Cleanup (Done)**: Handled automatically by the `supabase.auth.signOut()` function.
*   **Task 16: Configure CORS for Production (Done)**: Added and configured the `cors` package on the Express server with a production whitelist.
*   **Task 17: Implement Rate Limiting on Auth Endpoints (Done)**: Added `express-rate-limit` to the Express server to protect against brute-force attacks.
*   **Task 18: Integrate Password Reset Flow (Done)**: Handled automatically by the Supabase Auth UI component.
*   **Task 19: Handle Session Timeout (Done)**: Implemented a `useIdleTimeout` hook to automatically log out users after 15 minutes of inactivity.
*   **Task 20: Connect to Existing Supabase Configuration (Done)**: Verified that both frontend and backend are connecting correctly.
*   **Task 21: Support User Profile Management (Done)**: Created a `useProfile` hook and a settings page for users to update their profiles.
*   **Task 22: Prepare for Token Usage Tracking (Done)**: Added logging to the backend middleware to track authenticated requests as a foundation for future analytics.
