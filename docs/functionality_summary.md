# Functionality Summary

This document provides a high-level overview of all implemented features in the Idea Factory application.

## Authentication & User Management ✅ ENHANCED
- **User Registration & Login**: Complete Supabase-based authentication system
- **Role-Based Authentication**: Admin and regular user roles with different permissions
- **Demo User System**: Pre-configured demo accounts for testing
  - Admin account: admin@ideafactory.com / admin123
  - Regular user: demo@ideafactory.com / demo123
- **Profile Management**: Automatic profile creation with role assignment
- **Session Management**: Proper auth state handling across the application
- **User Interface**: Enhanced auth status display with role indicators

## Content Generation ✅

---

## Core Backend Infrastructure
- **Project Setup:** A robust backend was initialized using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript, providing a scalable foundation for the application.
- **Health Check:** A basic `/api/v1/health` endpoint was created to monitor the status of the server.
- **Database Client:** A central Supabase client was configured in `backend/src/database` to interact with the Supabase backend, using the service role key for administrative tasks.

## AI & Content Generation
- **Text Generation:** Integrated the OpenAI API (GPT-4o) to generate text content from a given prompt. This is exposed via the `/api/v1/ai/text` endpoint.
- **Image Generation:** Integrated the OpenAI API (DALL-E 3) to generate images from a prompt. The generated image URL is returned via the `/api/v1/ai/image` endpoint.

## Social Media Integration
- **Instagram Authentication:** Implemented the initial steps of the Instagram Basic Display API OAuth 2.0 flow. The backend can generate an authorization URL and exchange the returned code for a user access token.
- **Note on Publishing:** The system includes a placeholder for future Instagram content publishing, correctly noting that this requires the more advanced Instagram Graph API.

## Content Management & Scheduling
- **Content Validation:** A modular content validation system was created. It includes placeholder logic to check for content quality, appropriateness, platform-specific rules, and duplicates. This provides a framework for ensuring all generated content meets predefined standards.
- **Scheduling System:** A cron-based scheduling service was implemented using `node-cron`. This allows for content to be scheduled for future "publishing" at specific times. The system is managed via the `/api/v1/scheduler` endpoints, which allow creating, listing, and deleting jobs.
- **Media Management & Storage:** Integrated with Supabase Storage to handle media uploads.
  - A Supabase Edge Function (`create-storage-bucket`) was created to programmatically create storage buckets.
  - The backend now has a service and an endpoint (`/api/v1/storage/upload`) to upload base64-encoded files directly to a specified Supabase bucket.

## Authentication & Security
- **Supabase Integration:** A complete, end-to-end authentication system was built using Supabase. It handles user sign-up, sign-in, and session management.
- **Backend Protection:** Express middleware was created to validate Supabase JWTs, protecting all necessary backend API routes and ensuring only authenticated users can access them.
- **Frontend State Management:** A suite of React hooks (`useAuth`, `useProfile`) and components (`<ProtectedRoute>`) were developed to manage auth state globally, protect frontend routes, and allow users to manage their profiles.
- **Automatic Token Handling:** The `ApiClient` was refactored to automatically fetch the latest session token from Supabase and attach it to every outgoing request.
- **Session Security:**
  - **Idle Timeout:** Users are automatically logged out after 15 minutes of inactivity.
  - **Rate Limiting:** The backend implements rate limiting on sensitive auth endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks.
  - **CORS:** A strict CORS policy is in place for production environments.
- **User Profile Sync:** A database trigger automatically creates a public user profile in the `profiles` table upon new user sign-up, which can then be managed by the user.

## API Client & System Resilience
- **Advanced API Client:** A new, modern `ApiClient` was built using the native `fetch` API. It serves as the central point for all backend communication.
- **Automatic JWT Refresh:** The client transparently handles JWT expiration. If an API call returns a 401 Unauthorized status, it will automatically attempt to refresh the session token with Supabase and retry the original request, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Resilient API Calls:** The client includes built-in retry logic with exponential backoff for network errors and 5xx server errors, making the application more robust against transient failures.
- **Performance Optimizations:**
  - **Request Deduplication:** Prevents identical, in-flight API requests from being sent multiple times.
  - **Response Caching:** Implements an in-memory cache for `GET` requests to provide instantaneous responses for frequently accessed data.
- **Specialized React Hooks:** A suite of custom hooks was developed to simplify API interactions in the UI:
  - **`useApi`:** A generic hook that manages the full lifecycle of an API call (loading, success, error states) and integrates with the `sonner` notification system for automatic user feedback.
  - **`useContentGeneration`:** A hook tailored for initiating content generation jobs.
  - **`useContentJob`:** A hook for polling the status of a running job.
  - **`useFileUpload`:** A hook that handles obtaining signed URLs and uploading files to storage, providing real-time progress updates.
- **Global System Feedback:**
  - **Standardized Notifications:** The application now uses the `sonner` library for all toast notifications, providing a consistent look and feel.
  - **Offline Indicator:** A global `OfflineIndicator` component, powered by a `useOnlineStatus` hook, automatically informs the user if their network connection is lost.
  - **Global Error Boundary:** The entire application is wrapped in an `ErrorBoundary` that catches any unhandled JavaScript errors and displays a user-friendly fallback UI (`ErrorDisplay`) instead of a white screen, preventing application crashes.
